## Additional information

1. Did you complete the project with direct collaborators or general support? If so, who did you collaborate with and what was/were their contribution(s)?
    1. Direct collaborators (students who will be turning in a version of the same project) and their contributions:
    2. General support (students who helped you with debugging, conceptual understanding, or the like) and their contributions:
2. Did you use LLMs or other AI models to generate text or code for this project? If so, which tools did you use and how did you use them? Remember in this class you *are* allowed (even encouraged) to use these tools for help with coding, but not for writing text. This can be very brief, just one or two sentences is fine unless you have more you'd like to add.
    1. answer here 
3. For off-the-menu projects only, did you complete the project as proposed? If not, what changed?
    1. answer here or n/a

## Assessed Objectives

Mark an objective attempt for any learning objectives you believe you have demonstrated in this assignment.

Mark when an objective attempt should count toward the 20 unique objectives requirement. If your attempt is successful, your grader will mark the standard as met on your objective-tracker document.

Below each learning objective is a list of general expectations for meeting that objective. You should aim to meet all expectations to earn a point for meeting the objective, but these are not rigid requirements. For example, writing a complex and creative function that uses multiple arguments and returns a complex output could meet the "parse and define functions and arguments" objective, even if it is only used in one context.

## Reflection

Optionally, you may provide a brief reflection on your experience with this project. What did you learn? What would you do differently next time? What was the most challenging part of the project? What was the most rewarding? You do not have to answer these questions directly; they are just meant to help you think about your experience.

Thoughtful reflections may earn engagement points.

## Grader feedback

-   Grader:
-   Date:
-   Points toward unique objectives (up to 20):
-   Additional points (up to 20):
-   TA provisional engagement points (up to 10):
-   Final approved engagement points (up to 10):
-   Total points (up to 50):

Engagement points are awarded for going above and beyond the expectations of the project and are not guaranteed on any given submission.. Demonstrating the assessed learning objectives earns you points in those categories, but engagement points are awarded for exceptional effort, creativity, or skill.

TAs may recommend engagement points provisionally, but the instructor will make the final decision on engagement points.
